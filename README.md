This is my Capital City Hangman project - a simple game to help people learn capital cities, and to pass the time.

Players guess the hidden capital city letter by letter, and each time the letter isn't featured, a part of the hangman drawing appears.

If they guess the capital before the picture is complete, they win, and if the don't, they lose but still find out the hidden city, and the country it belongs to.  There is a counter which lets players know how many parts of the hangman drawing are remaining.

Type git clone, and then paste the URL.

**You are done!** Now you can start playing the React App or editing it in the new folder that's created.

This is a useful project to demonstrate the creation of a simple application using **JavaScript (React)**. It has a re-start feature and also you can navigate between the components with hyperlinks (Router, Route and Link).
The main purpose of this project is to learn how to use hooks like usestate useEffect etc...
